# Bluetooth Reset
I am currently using CyanogenMod 12.1 on my HTC M8 and it currently has a bug where the Bluetooth
Service fails intermittently and the it will only restart after clearing the data of the Bluetooth
Share app.

This app automates this.

It *should* work on non Cyanogen roms as well.

# Notes
* Requires root.
* Will only work on API 22 devices (AKA LOLLIPOP_MR1)
* PRs welcome.
